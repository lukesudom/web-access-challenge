# web-access-challenge

Improved Horiseon's codebase so that it follows accessibility standards and such that the site is optimized for search engines.

When you view the source code you will find it follows semantic HTML elements

When you view the HTML elements you will find they follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Images have accessible alt attributes and title attributes

Heading attributes fall in sequential order

Concise title - Horiseon Social Solution Services

The main challenge for this piece of code was organising the HTML and CSS in a structure that follows best practices.

There were also some issues with the CSS linkage that i fixed up
